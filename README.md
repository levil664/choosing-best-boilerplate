Where [canary](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary) is the boilerplate provided by the development team [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). next-redux talks about a bundle of technologies that demonstrates the use of [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs) in conjunction with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) in the project.
